    <h2 id="opfor_sol_pragmata">OPFOR: 155th Sól Pragmata <span style="color:grey">- July 2020</span></h2>

    <blockquote>
        The 155th's first combat distinction was awarded eleven centuries ago for their actions in the Lurongyu Mutiny.
        While regimental historians trace the origin world to either the Saul or Zal the Departmento Munitorum
        classifies it as "Composite Regiment" constituted out of 43 regimental remnants.
        The Sól Pragmata has managed to endure through a strong tradition of opportunistic and aggressive recruitment.
        In addition to bolstering their numbers, their training camps have more than once served as the kernel of the
        155th's resurrection when the combat companies suffer catastrophic losses.

    <p>While waiting for better bases for my Emperor's Spears I've been assembling my Imperial Guard armour from <a
            href="https://www.trolls.cz/">Trollz</a>. One Tank Company of ten Leman Russes, including one Vanquisher,
        seven Chimeras for a Mechanized Infantry Company or Regimental HQ and a single Baneblade. This is about 1000
        points which paired with 1000 points of Emperor's Spears will be what I use to demonstrate
        the game for friends and other interested.
    </p>

    <center> <img width="60%" src="./img/armouredcompanyassembled.jpeg"></center>

    <p>The models are beautifully detailed, and while the Leman Russ can look a little goofy in 28mm it's a really fun
        little model in 6mm. I'm probably going to paint them in the dirty white with dark red of my home-grown regiment
        the 155th Sól Pragmata. Another perk of Epic is that it allows me to field that Imperial Guard army I never
        could bring myself to paint. I'm about 30% done with the first infantry squad...</p>

    <h2 id="emperors_spears_rhino">6mm Emperor's Spears Rhino <span style="color:grey">- June 2020</span></h2>

    <p> Since last entry, I've been trying all manner of colour schemes. I painted a very ugly yellow Rhino, a very good
        pink and tried out an all metallic Doom Eagles. None really clicked; the yellow was ugly, the pink was way too
        much effort and the metallic silver looks flat in 6mm scale. I came back to the fact that blue is a pretty good
        colour. As I didn't want to do Ultramarines but among the off-brand blue Chapters I found the Emperor's Spears:
    </p>

    <center> <img width="60%" src="./img/emperors_spears_rhino.jpeg"></center>

    <p> The blue might be a smidge too dark for Emperor's Spears, but it's straight out of a spray can which is a huge
        plus. (Sadly, I don't yet have the space for an airbrush setup.) The steps are Vallejo Magic Blue primer, some
        sparse edge highlighting, white and grey details followed by oil washes (phthalo blue and lamp black). Using oil
        rather than acrylic washes really helps on such angular models as vehicles. You can easily undo mistakes and
        preserve that clean surface.</p>

    <p>
        Overall I'm quite happy with it. It's a cleaner look my usual blanchitsu-esque style which this scale demand,
        and I can pump-out nine Rhinos easily. Next steps are to read the Emperor's Spears book and paint some tactical
        marines.

    <h2 id="crimson_fists_rhino">6mm Crimson Fists Test Rhino <span style="color:grey">- June 2020</span></h2>

    <p>The next step in my 6mm adventure is to figure out how to paint my tiny marines. The Crimson Fists are as old
        school as they come which seemed fitting with an old school game. So I painted up a Rhino in their dark blue.
    </p>

    <center> <img width="60%" src="./img/crimsonfists_test_rhino.jpg"></center>

    <p>I'm not convinced yet, the dark blue might just be too dark blue, and the black oil wash isn't doing it any
        favours in that regard. Without the stark wash, however, there wasn't much depth to the figure. Maybe I should
        consider a brighter coloured chapter? Doom Eagles?</p>

    <h2 id="starting_epic">Starting Epic <span style="color:grey">- June 2020</span></h2>

    <p>Recently I've caught a 6mm bug. I've been playing <i>Epic: Armageddon</i>, specifically the community-supported
        <a href="https://tp.net-armageddon.org/">NetEA</a> variant, and have enjoyed it immensely. The small
        scale and the abstracted ruleset allows for a sense of tactical play it's bigger brother 40k seldom did.
    </p>

    <p>Until now I've been playing with carton board proxies but I went a bit excessive and ordered figures from third
        parties such as <a href="https://vanguardminiatures.co.uk/">Vanguard</a> and <a
            href="https://www.trolls.cz/">Trollz</a> as well as bidding on eBay auctions.
        From one such auction, I scored ten old-school Land Raiders and nine rhinos for less than the shipping cost. I'm
        currently in the process of stripping them (someone did <b>not</b> use two thin coats) and agonizing over the
        colour scheme. At the very moment I'm contemplating the yellow of the Marines Malevolent as I got a magenta oil
        wash I'm itching to use.</p>
