    <p>The next step in my 6mm adventure is to figure out how to paint my tiny marines. The Crimson Fists are as old
        school as they come which seemed fitting with an old school game. So I painted up a Rhino in their dark blue.

    <p>I'm not convinced yet, the dark blue might just be too dark blue, and the black oil wash isn't doing it any
        favours in that regard. Without the stark wash, however, there wasn't much depth to the figure. Maybe I should
        consider a brighter coloured chapter? Doom Eagles?</p>

    <h2 id="starting_epic">Starting Epic <span style="color:grey">- June 2020</span></h2>

    <p>Recently I've caught a 6mm bug. I've been playing <i>Epic: Armageddon</i>, specifically the community-supported
        <a href="https://tp.net-armageddon.org/">NetEA</a> variant, and have enjoyed it immensely. The small
        scale and the abstracted ruleset allows for a sense of tactical play it's bigger brother 40k seldom did.
    </p>

    <p>Until now I've been playing with carton board proxies but I went a bit excessive and ordered figures from third
        parties such as <a href="https://vanguardminiatures.co.uk/">Vanguard</a> and <a
            href="https://www.trolls.cz/">Trollz</a> as well as bidding on eBay auctions.
        From one such auction, I scored ten old-school Land Raiders and nine rhinos for less than the shipping cost. I'm
        currently in the process of stripping them (someone did <b>not</b> use two thin coats) and agonizing over the
        colour scheme. At the very moment I'm contemplating the yellow of the Marines Malevolent as I got a magenta oil
        wash I'm itching to use.</p>
