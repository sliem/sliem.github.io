<body>
    <p>My name is <b>Sebastian Liem</b>.
        I'm a data scientist at <a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/">ChargePoint</a> where I work to make it easier
        for
        public transportation companies and the public to transition to electric vehicles.
        I transition into industry from astroparticle physics where I worked to figure out <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/search/hep-ph?searchtype=author&query=Liem%2C+S">particle nature of dark matter.</a>
        I did a lot of statistical and machine learning work for high dimensional models which translated nicely into
        data science.</p>

    <p>I'm also an avid miniature wargamer, I spend about an hour each day painting models, you can see my painting log
        on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polychrome28/">instagram</a>.</p>

            Identifying WIMP dark matter from particle and astroparticle data
        </summary>
        <blockquote>
            One of the most promising strategies to identify the nature of dark matter consists in the search
            for new
            particles at accelerators and with so-called direct detection experiments. Working within the framework of
            simplified models, and making use of machine learning tools to speed up statistical inference, we address
            the question of what we can learn about dark matter from a detection at the LHC and a forthcoming direct
            detection experiment. We show that with a combination of accelerator and direct detection data, it is
            possible to identify newly discovered particles as dark matter, by reconstructing their relic density
            assuming they are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) thermally produced in the early Universe, and
            demonstrating that it is consistent with the measured dark matter abundance. An inconsistency between these
            two quantities would instead point either towards additional physics in the dark sector, or towards a
            non-standard cosmology, with a thermal history substantially different from that of the standard
            cosmological model.

            Accelerating the BSM interpretation of LHC data with machine learning
        </summary>
        <blockquote>
            The interpretation of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data in the framework of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
            theories is hampered by the need to run computationally expensive event generators and detector simulators.
            Performing statistically convergent scans of high-dimensional BSM theories is consequently challenging, and
            in practice unfeasible for very high-dimensional BSM theories. We present here a new machine learning method
            that accelerates the interpretation of LHC data, by learning the relationship between BSM theory parameters
            and data. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this technique accurately predicts natural SUSY signal
            events in two signal regions at the High Luminosity LHC, up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard
            techniques. The new approach makes it possible to rapidly and accurately reconstruct the theory parameters
            of complex BSM theories, should an excess in the data be discovered at the LHC.

            Barrett: out-of-core processing of MultiNest output
        </summary>
        <blockquote>
            Barrett is a Python package for processing and visualising statistical inferences made using the nested
            sampling algorithm MultiNest. The main differential feature from competitors are full out-of-core
            processing allowing barrett to handle arbitrarily large datasets. This is achieved by using the HDF5
            data format.

            Dark matter interpretations of ATLAS searches for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles
            in √s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions
        </summary>
        <blockquote>
            A selection of searches by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for the electroweak production of SUSY
            particles are used to study their impact on the constraints on dark matter candidates. The searches
            use 20 fb^−1 of proton-proton collision data at √s = 8 TeV. A likelihood-driven scan of a
            five-dimensional effective model focusing on the gaugino--higgsino and Higgs sector of the
            phenomenological minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is performed. This scan uses data from direct
            dark matter detection experiments, the relic dark matter density and precision flavour physics
            results. Further constraints from the ATLAS Higgs mass measurement and SUSY searches at LEP are also
            applied. A subset of models selected from this scan are used to assess the impact of the selected
            ATLAS searches in this five-dimensional parameter space. These ATLAS searches substantially impact
            those models for which the mass m(χ̃^0_1) of the lightest neutralino is less than 65 GeV, excluding
            86% of such models. The searches have limited impact on models with larger m(χ̃^0_1) due to either
            heavy electroweakinos or compressed mass spectra where the mass splittings between the produced
            particles and the lightest supersymmetric particle is small.

            Effective Field Theory of Dark Matter: a Global Analysis
        </summary>
        <blockquote>
            We present global fits of an effective field theory description of real, and complex scalar dark
            matter candidates. We simultaneously take into account all possible dimension 6 operators
            consisting of dark matter bilinears and gauge invariant combinations of quark and gluon fields.
            We derive constraints on the free model parameters for both the real (five parameters) and
            complex (seven) scalar dark matter models obtained by combining Planck data on the cosmic
            microwave background, direct detection limits from LUX, and indirect detection limits from the
            Fermi Large Area Telescope. We find that for real scalars indirect dark matter searches
            disfavour a dark matter particle mass below 100 GeV. For the complex scalar dark matter particle
            current data have a limited impact due to the presence of operators that lead to p-wave
            annihilation, and also do not contribute to the spin-independent scattering cross- section.
            Although current data are not informative enough to strongly constrain the theory parameter
            space, we demonstrate the power of our formalism to reconstruct the theoretical parameters
            compatible with an actual dark matter detection, by assuming that the excess of gamma rays
            observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope towards the Galactic centre is entirely due to dark
            matter annihilations. Please note that the excess can very well be due to astrophysical sources
            such as millisecond pulsars. We find that scalar dark matter interacting via effective field
            theory operators can in principle explain the Galactic centre excess, but that such
            interpretation is in strong tension with the non-detection of gamma rays from dwarf galaxies in
            the real scalar case. In the complex scalar case there is enough freedom to relieve the tension.

                My Master’s thesis. I investigated how to reinterpret experimental constraints on simplified
                models as constraints on supersymmetric models such as the cMSSM and the pMSSM. I also
